# Hello my name is NINOOOOOOOOOOO
---
A quiz game involving pages from the Gotoubun no Hanayome/The Quintessential Quintuplets special colour manga. The page is cropped to show **Nino Nakano** in a page with some (or very little) context and you either:
- Identify which *volume* that the given page is from (1 point)
- Identify which *chapter* that the given page is from (5 points)

You can accumulate a combo for identifying the correct volume **OR** chapter multiple times in a row. This combo provides bonus points based on its length:
For a combo of **[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5+]**
- For *volumes*, the combo bonus is **[0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]**
- For *chapters*, the combo bonus is **[0, 0, 2, 5, 7, 10]**

There is also a *history* button that pulls up a modal with all of the past panels that were seen. Click on a panel in the bottom section to display a larger version. Click the enlarged version to open the full image in a new tab. You can leave the history modal by clicking any blank space in the background.

This should just run in the browser as long as JavaScript is enabled. Game will probably look weird on smaller browser windows and on mobile browsers.

## Right now there are **199 images** spanning the first 3 volumes of the series, or the first 23 chapters.

### Special thanks
