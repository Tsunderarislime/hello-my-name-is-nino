# Hello my name is NINOOOOOOOOOOO
---
A fun quiz game involving pages from the Gotoubun no Hanayome/The Quintessential Quintuplets special colour manga. The page is cropped to only show **Nino Nakano** and you either:
- Identify which *volume* that the given page is from (1 point)
- Identify which *chapter* that the given page is from (5 points)

This should just run in the browser as long as JavaScript is enabled. May look weird on smaller browser windows.

## Special thanks
