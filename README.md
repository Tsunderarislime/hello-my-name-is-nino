# Hello my name is NINOOOOOOOOOOO
---
A fun quiz game involving pages from the Gotoubun no Hanayome/The Quintessential Quintuplets special colour manga. The page is cropped to show **Nino Nakano** in a page with some (or very little) context and you either:
- Identify which *volume* that the given page is from (1 point)
- Identify which *chapter* that the given page is from (5 points)

This should just run in the browser as long as JavaScript is enabled. May look weird on smaller browser windows.

# [Play the game](https://tsunderarislime.github.io/hello-my-name-is-nino/main.html)
## Right now there are 135 images spanning the first 2 volumes of the series, or the first 14 chapters.

### Special thanks
